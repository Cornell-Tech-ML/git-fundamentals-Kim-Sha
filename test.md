As a relative mainstay in the solar industry today, Sunrun has evolved far beyond the bounds of the attic that used to house it. In just over 10 years, the company has swelled to house over 3000 employees serving 189,000 customers in 23 states. Its measured approach has ultimately [beaten out highly-publicized competitors such as SolarCity](https://www.investors.com/gdpr-agreement/?back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investors.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology%2Fsunrun-overtakes-teslas-solar-city-as-top-solar-lease-firm%2F) in the residential leasing market. Now, the company is gaining the confidence to expand into new markets. In just under four months, Sunrun entered 7 new states to target 12 million candidates, nearly [doubling its total available market](https://investors.sunrun.com/).

The steady guiding hand of Lynn Jurich has much to do with the company’s successful navigation through a volatile industry landscape. A cursory glance paints a complex picture of Jurich’s character, which appears full of contradictions. A kind face frames a pair of steely eyes. A calm demeanor belies edge-of-the-seat passion. An affable tone does a poor job of concealing the powerhouse resume that lies behind those words.

> Founding a company doesn’t mean sitting in a cushy chair and giving orders. It means being in the trenches and spending your Saturday afternoons staffing a booth at a county fair to recruit customers.

During Sunrun’s infancy, Jurich landed one of her first customers standing next to a giant pumpkin at the Yolo County Fair in Sacramento. Intending to discuss her product with local homeowners, she found herself preaching to a sea of averted gazes. The few that paid attention seemed to do so just to shoot her down. But when she finally persuaded an owner of a trucking company to try solar, she realized the value of famer’s markets and county fairs. Here, she could receive quick and direct feedback, providing rapid learning cycles for her to improve her business. Indeed, Jurich would be the first to point to those experiences as being formative in the development of Sunrun.

Today, Sunrun is no longer a scrappy startup experimenting with a disruptive business model. Lynn Jurich was among the first to make solar energy accessible to the masses, and that has fueled the company’s growth so far. After all, she wasn’t in the business of technologically disrupting an industry – she just wanted to change our very conception of it.
